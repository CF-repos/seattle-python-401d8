# Data Structures: Singly-Linked List

## Overview
![linked-list](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/slugbyte-assets/linked-list.svg)

#### Singly Linked List
There are **No** LIFO/FIFO-style constraints on linked lists
  * **LIFO** - last in first out
  * **FIFO** - first in first out
  _We will talk more about this soon!_

Singly linked lists contain a series of nodes where each node contains a `value` as well as a `next` property. This property points to the next node in a line of interconnected nodes.
* operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * insertion (ie: `push` and methods)
  * deletion (ie: `remove` method)
  * traversal (ie: `find` method)

<!-- #### Doubly Linked List
There are no FILO/FIFO-style constraints on doubly linked lists.

Doubly linked lists contain a series of nodes where each node contains a `value`, a `next` property, and a `prev` property.  These properties point to the previous and next node in a line of interconnected nodes.
* operations that can be performed on singly linked lists include:
  * insertion (ie: `push` and `unshift` methods)
  * deletion (ie: `pop`, `shift`, and `remove` method)
  * traversal (ie: `findX`, `findAndX` method) -->
