## Analysis: Movies and Pollution

**This is a solo assignment**

You learned some of the theory, now let's apply it to some data.
Today we’ll work with two data sets: the [IMDB 5000 Movies Dataset](https://data.world/popculture/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

### Specifications
- In your `data-science` repository, create a branch called `class-07-probability`
- Create a new Jupyter notebook: `imdb-notebook`

- **DO NOT COMMIT THIS DATA SET!**
    - **REPEAT: Do not commit the data set. It's too large for Github, and you'll create problems**

- **Seriously. I don't want to have to fix this for you. Please don't commit it at all. Ever.**

- In `imdb-notebook` answer/fulfill the following:
**Find an opportunity within your dataset to generate _at least four_ meaningful visuals. For example, use visuals to illustrate a conclusion to one of your questions!**
    1. What's the probability that a movie was longer than an hour and a half? Two hours?
    1. What's the probability that a movie was directed by Steven Spielberg?
    1. What's the probability that a movie directed by Clint Eastwood will gross under budget?
    1. What's the probability that a movie generally grossed more than its budget?
    1. What's the probability that a movie grossed over the average gross of this data set?
    1. For ratings we'll consider a movie with at least a 6/10 to be worth renting, if not seeing in theaters. A **false positive** would be a movie that was highly-rated but did poorly in the box office (gross < budget). A **false negative** would be a movie that was poorly-rated but did great in the box office (gross < budget).
    1. In the IMDB dataset, what are the false positive and false negative rates? Can you provide some examples of each?
    1. If I’m a production studio exec and Tom Hanks is starring in my movie but I’m feeling uncertain about whether we should keep him (will he make as much money as we want?), tell me should I keep him in the movie or switch him out for Harrison Ford?
    1. Same as above, but I’m judging on the ratings of the movie instead of the gross/budget.
    1. What’s the probability that a movie’s length will be between 1hr 10mins and 1h 30mins?
    1. How does the distribution of movie budgets compare to the movie gross values?
    1. Which genre trends toward the highest gross-to-budget ratio? You may have to do some extra parsing to answer this question.
    1. Nicolas Cage is known for starring in some pretty bad movies. Are his movies statistically significantly worse (i.e. in rating) than the rest of the IMDB 5000+?
    1. Have any years grossed a statistically-significant higher amount than the other years?

- When you're done answering all of the questions for each data set, clean up your notebooks leaving only cells that contain relevant data and calculations. Then restart and run your notebook so that the cell numbering is sequential from top to bottom


### Submission
1. Create a pull request from your `class-07-probability` branch to your `master` branch.
2. In your open pull request, leave as a comment [a checklist](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents) of the specifications, with the actual specifications you completed checked off.
3. Copy the link to your open pull request and paste it into the corresponding Canvas assignment.
4. Leave any comments you may have about the assignment in the comments box. This includes any difficulties you may have had with the assignment.
5. Merge `class-07-probability` into `master`
