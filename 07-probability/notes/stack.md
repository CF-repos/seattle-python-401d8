Stacks are a data structure that serve as a collection of elements. These elements are stacked in a last in, first out sequence **(aka FILO - first in, last out)**. It may help to think about a stack as a collection of plates and the way that you add and remove them.

Common methods include:
    * `pop` removes the most recent element from the stack
    * `push` adds a new element to the stack
    * `peek` returns the node value at the top of the stack without mutating any of the existing structure of the stack

Example implementations / use cases for Stacks:
    * Call Stacks
    * Forward/Back Browser Features
    * Undo/Redo OS Features
