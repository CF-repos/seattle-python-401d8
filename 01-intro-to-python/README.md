Ensure that you've completed the [401 Python Pre-work](https://github.com/codefellows/code-401-Python-prework)
It's extremely critical that you're set up and ready to go on day 1, and if not you need to notify your instructor as soon as possible regarding any of the pre-work that you were unable to complete (including what you were able to complete).
