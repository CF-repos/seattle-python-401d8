# ![cf](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) Class 04: Functional Programming, Python Classes, and Fixtures

## Daily Plan
- Notes:
    - Anything top of mind?

- Code Review & Packaging! _carry-over from yesterday_
- Functional Programming
    - `map`, `filter`, and lambdas
- Classes & OOP
- Pytest Fixtures
- Lab Preview


## Learning Objectives

- Students will learn about how to properly use the Python lambda function
- Students will learn about the sorted, map, and filter functions
- Students will finally encounter the Python class
- Students will write better test suites by abstracting reusable objects into fixtures

## Outline

- Code Review
- [Object-Oriented Programming and Python Classes]
- [Class Inheritance and Composition]
- [Anonymous Functions and Functional Programming]
- [Pytest Fixtures]
